            Mistakes -- we all make them! What if, instead of avoiding them, we embraced them, seeing them as opportunities to take our learning to the next level? In his book, Teach Like a Champion 2.0, veteran educator Doug Lemov talks about creating a classroom environment where “...students feel safe making and discussing mistakes, so you can spend less time hunting for errors and more time fixing them...” Doug outlines four key methods:
            1.	Expect error
            2.	Withhold answers
            3.	Manage your tell
            4.	Praise risk-taking
            </p>
