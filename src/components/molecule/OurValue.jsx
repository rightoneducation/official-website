            We’re a team that sometimes falls down, always gets back up, and never stops having fun.
            Trust and open communication: seeking to understand, then to be understood
            Integrity: doing the right thing
            Compassion: lending a hand to others, giving back, expressing gratitude
            Humility: working together on something bigger than ourselves
            Beginner’s mindset: going into things with an open mind, always learning and making new mistakes
            Fun: having fun along the way!
